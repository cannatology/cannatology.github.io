As the tag-line suggests, I dabble in photography. I was taking
some pictures of Northern Lights I came across at The Green Room
in Oklahoma City (and yes I recommend this place, say hello to
Ron if you stop by).

I found this one to be pretty cool

It's a 1x macro using a Canon EF 180 3.5. I used my macro 
flash as when using my MP-E 65, I set manual exposure, 
1/200, f8 and let the flash fill fill in as necessary.

That is a bit of Northern Lights about to be ground. 
The darker areas of the picture are a grinder. If you
look closely, there are plenty trichomes to be seen.
