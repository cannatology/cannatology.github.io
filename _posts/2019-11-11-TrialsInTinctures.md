    This is a recent experience report from making different kinds of tinctures.
    All of these tinctures involved cannabis, but each used a different solvent.
    What follows are my observations.

## Overview

My friend Ron at The Green Room in OKC has a 
[Magic Butter Machine](https://www.magicalbutter.com/)
he loans me from time to time. I've used it 4 times to make three different
basic tinctures. What follows is my recommendation, and then the other
things I've tried.

## My Recommendation

My favorite so far uses [MCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride) 
oil as the solvent. In my case, the MCT oil was coconut oil. Whole coconut oil is 
three different oils. Two are liquid at typical room temperatures. The third is solid.

If you are worried about increasing your good fat, you want the 
oil that is solid at room temperature. I have not personally tried 
full coconut oil, though I know it works based on what friends have
told me. Also, early on I bought a container of coconut oil that
hand a claimed 1000 MG THC. I made a batch or brownies that were OK.

### Ingredients

* 40 OZ of MCT oil that (from Costco this time)
* About 2 OZ sugar leaves from White Widow
* 3 - 4 pucks from live rosin pressings
* Fresh mango

### Batches

Batch 1
* 20 OZ MTC Oil
* Half sugar leaves
* All the pucks

Batch 2
* 20 OZ MCT Oil
* Half sugar leaves
* Fresh mango (guessing about 1.5 oz)

### The Steps
Note, most of this is right out of the Magic Butter Machine manual. I have added 
a few details and excellent color commentary.

* Decarb the sugar leaves in a sealed glass container at 220 F for 30 minutes
* Let the sugar leaves cool to where you can safely handle the glass container. This allows low any interesting low temperature components to rejoin their recently departed flower
* Add MCT oil, decarbed herb, and optional mango to the magic butter machine,
* Set it on 8 hours at 130 degrees 
* Run it again for 8 hours at 130 degrees (I have no idea if this is overkill, almost certainly it is, but I am patient and I won't argue with the results)
* Strain the oil using the supplied 220 NM sized filter bag
* Strained the strained oil using a metal coffee filter meant for drip coffee [this is the one I use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RYD17F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I think you should keep this refrigerated until you use it. The MCT oil is fine (though refrigeration will slow down oxidation), but I'm not sure about the organic components that remain in the tincture.

## The Effects

I use this sublingually. It helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. Before THC, it had been easily a decade since
I had slept more than 4 - 5 hours of restful sleep. The first time I took 10 MG, I slept for 8 hours and was
completely clear headed.

I personally know 6 people who have tried tinctures made following these steps (not sure about the second
filtering stage, but that's actually hardly necessary with the MCT oil). All of them have had similar
experiences with recipe.

One friend has tried this recipe and found it helps chronic pain from 25+ years of martial arts practice.
His first report was "I haven't felt pain in 16 hours" when talking about his neck pain.

### Why?

I don't know. Here's what I think. This is essentially low-temperature (raw-esque) cooking. The MCT oil
might make the components in the flower more bio available.

When you low-temp dry-herb vape, you get a fuller-body effect than if you burn a blunt, or use a bong. Even
if you use an ice bong to cool the smoke, the damages is already done. Sure you've activated the THC, but 
you've destroyed many volatile organic components, the terpenes, that make each strain a bit different.
In fact, I personally prefer the characteristics introduces by terpenes over just THC or CBD, even 
if one is fun and the other is relaxing.

So we capture the entire plant in an easy to ingest formula. The tincutre uptakes faster because it's getting
into the blood stream more quickly because of the blood and saliva vessels under the tongue.

You'll get similar, if not more sleep inducing effects, if you simply ingest the tincture. The same thing 
is true if you simply decarb the week and eat it whole.

In fact, after dry herb vapping, either eat the herb or save it for future tinctures. This is assuming your
dry herb vape temperature does not go too high. If you stop at 428 F (or even 437 F which is the boiling point of
Citronellol), the resulting herb is edible and still active.

At 451 is combustion, there's a book about that. 

If you use a bong, here's a difference:
* Dry herb vape for a few days withough changing the water, the water is drinkable (I've confirmed)
* Burn week in bong for a few days. Sure you can drink the water, it's full of ash.

At low temperatures you get vapor, not smoke.

So much like you get different nutrients from raw food and cooked food (one is not always better than 
the other), the same is true of week. In fact, if you don't decarb the week, the THCa will no become
Delta-9 THC and you won't get the high.

You will probably benefit from the the terpenes, but a little THC has been shown
to enhance the impact of CBD when CBD helps a person at all (CBC is great if it works for your condition
but it probably won't help physical nerve damage). CBD moderates THC (slows the uptake of THC as both
compete for the CBD receptors) to give a longer but lower high. There's an urban legend that 
mango enhances the update of THC as the myrcene reduces the time for THC to cross the brain-blood barrier
(5 seconds versus 7). Black peppercorn will help with THC induced anxiety (Ocimene in whole black pepper 
tends to enhance the update the the form of THC that tends towards body hight, while slowing the uptake
of the form of THC with psych-active effects).
