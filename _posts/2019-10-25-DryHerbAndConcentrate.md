title: Dry Herb and Concentrate

## Background
I mostly dab. That means I have something hot, to which I bring
cold concentrate. I might use a banger, a nail, or even an electric
honey straw that attaches to a bong.

Mostly I use my [Huni Badger](https://www.hunibadger.com/). I 
have the [bubbler](https://www.hunibadger.com/Water-Bubblers-and-Adapters/Nectar-Collector-Honeybird-Core-with-HBNC-adaptor)
for travel. When I'm at home or my current hotel(where I keep luggage), 
I use a recycler or larger bubbler.

I recommend all the things I mention in this blog 
but I am (currently) in no way compensated for these recommendations. I purchased 
all products myself.

## The [Foreign](https://stevenmsmith.com/ar-satir-change-model/)Element
 
Recently I forgot most of my kit and had only my [Arizer Argo](https://arizer.com/argo/)
available. Up until this experience, I really liked my Argo, but 
my go-to was concentrate and sometimes dry herb.

Something made me wonder why I couldn't embed concentrate in the dry
herb and then use my Argo. I did maybe 5 minutes of "research" and
confirmed what chemistry would suggest. There's sticky stuff in 
dry herb. Concentrate is sticky. All that sticky stuff evaporates
based on its chemical content. And it's all glass and otherwise easy to clean.

This idea in mind, a buddy and I set forth to make a dry-herb based 
concoction. We filled up the tube, removed a bit, then mixed in a small
dab of concentrate, a little kief, then more dry herb.

## Eureka
First time out we got amazing results. What we both experienced was a fairly
good body high and a decent head high.

Generally when I stick to dry herb vaping, I get mostly a body high 
and some at most a small head high. This is impacted my patience and 
[temperature](https://schuchert.github.io/wikispaces/pages/cannabis/Basics.html)
- hint, more of both for better results.

When I stick to concentrate, the effect is generally more towards the head.

## The Kicker
Dry herb + concentrate was nicely in the middle. That is, until we decided to give it a kick.

I think the kick idea came from an earlier experience of intermittent fasting
then having fresh mango, and the one big dab. When I did this, what would
normally have been relaxing (enhanced music experience) surprised me in a wonderful way.

So if you want a full version of this:

| # | What | Notes |
|---| ---- | ----- |
| 1 | Intermittent fasting | Minimum 12 hours, longer better |
| 2 | Eat mango | fresh, mochi, dried - in fact this is likely placebo, but mangos are yummy
| 3 | Wait for the mango to kick in | 45 mins - again, probably myth but mangos really are yummy and they even keep out misquotes - in fact, go ahead and eat mangos, but don't wait |
| 4 | Dry-herb vape | There's technique to this in working with temperatures, so, for example, in a 15 minute session on one bowl, start at 383, when the vape reduces, try 401, then 428. [Temperatures](https://schuchert.github.io/wikispaces/pages/cannabis/Basics.html) |
| 5 | Take one "big" dab| Once the dry herb kicks in, take one "big" dab and hold it in. "Big" means big for your level of experience/tolerance. |

</aside>

Mango has myrcene. It also occurs cannabis, to varying degrees.
Myrcene speeds up the transition of THC across the blood-brain barrier, but
according to [this good paper](https://owlcation.com/stem/The-Mango-Myrcene-THC-Connection-Is-it-For-Real) it
probably is a both a myth an real.

It is real in the sense that it does impact the update of THC. The rate is from 7 to 4 seconds.
If that is simply the delay to the onset, then that's not much of a change. If that has to do
with the rate of uptake, then a decrease of nearly 43% they that's a big deal.

Even so, skipping the mango, and even the intermittent fasting still gives great results. Thus
it is probably a myth.

## Kicker Kicker. 

This is a highly speculative follow up that I've not repeated, so take with a grain of salt.

I accidentally had what I'd say is a minor psychedelic experience. Unfortunately, I've never
had an actual psychedelic experience. I'm reading 
[How to Change Your Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/1594204225)
and based on what I'm reading, and personal accounts, I'd say this might count. And I have
a theory as to why. First the experience, then my swag as to what happened.

### The experience

About an hour after the "big" dab the first time, I was in my hotel
room and decided to practice [Liuhebafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liuhebafa). I 
was going for an especially slow practice.

I've been taught to practice both [Liuhebafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liuhebafa) and 
[Tai Chi Chuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/103-form_Yang_family_tai_chi_chuan) in a style
that is more of a walking meditation. That means slow, controlled movements, and breathing.

I was coordinated my breath to the music and each part of each move. 
I was listening [Lana Del Ray's](https://lanadelrey.com/) amazing 
[Norman Fuckng Rockwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Fucking_Rockwell!). 
All the songs are slow. I generally use 8 beats for a single step. 4 beats for the Yin part
and 4 for the Yang part.

Finally, I had my eyes either closed or mostly closed and de-focused.

After the opening move, as I closed my eyes, the typical 
[floaters](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-floaters/symptoms-causes/syc-20372346)
looked more like long strands that move in synchronicity with my hands.
As this happened, I felt "energy" surround my body and escape up 
(from about the middle of my torso). I shuttered a bit to get my breath under control.

I've had this experience once recently. During a 10 minute standing meditation, 
[Rick Krause](http://www.taichiokc.com/) made an alignment adjustment to my mid spine.
That is, he gave me a gentle nudge (first confirming it was ok). I felt electric
currents very much like the experience just described. But this lasted 10 seconds.

I assume this is something in my Limbic system causing a rush of hormones. But 
whatever, it's a pretty amazing experience.

### What might be happening

According to [How to Change Your Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/1594204225),
one theory of how the brain works suggests that deep meditation and psychedelics both
inhibit the [Default Mode Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network).

The actual impact is different, but the effect seems to have some similarity. Meditation
generally quiets most/all of the nodes in the default mode network. Psychedelics
tend to reduce blood flow to I think three different nodes.

### Why does this matter.

If you want to extend your experience, you might try a number of techniques such as
meditation, breadth practice, energy work.
